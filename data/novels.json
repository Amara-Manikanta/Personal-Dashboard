Keep staring at the rose. Notice its color, texture and design. Savor its fragrance and think only about this wonderful object in front of you. At first, other thoughts will start entering your mind, distracting you from the heart of the rose. This is the mark of an untrained mind. But you need not worry, improvement will come quickly. Simply return your attention to the object of your focus. Soon your mind will grow strong and disciplined.",

She was being dependent on me and that I never wanted to make her do. I wanted to make her independent flying girl who wanted to live with her dreams that she dreamt but never discussed with anyone."
